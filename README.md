# California_House_Pricing-
The California House Pricing project involves analyzing housing data from California to understand the factors influencing house prices and to build a predictive model.


The project typically begins with data collection and loading, using libraries like pandas and numpy to handle and manipulate the dataset efficiently. Exploratory data analysis (The process of examining and visualizing a dataset to understand its main characteristics, detect patterns, spot anomalies which helps in making informed decisions about data cleaning, feature selection, and modeling.), is performed using matplotlib and seaborn, which helps visualize distributions, detect correlations, and identify trends or anomalies in variables such as median income, average rooms, location, and house age.

Preprocessing steps may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if any, and standardizing features using StandardScaler to normalize the data for better model performance. The dataset is then split into training and testing subsets using train_test_split to ensure the model is trained on one portion and evaluated on unseen data.

A Linear Regression model is applied to capture the linear relationships between features and house prices, and predictions are generated for the test set.

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, and R-squared (RÂ²), which indicates the proportion of variance in house prices explained by the model.

Throughout the project, insights gained from EDA and model evaluation can help understand which factors most strongly impact housing prices, providing actionable information for buyers, sellers, and policymakers.
